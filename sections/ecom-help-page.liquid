Here in the UK, our Pay later product has no interest or fees, which lets you make sure you love your purchase before paying anything.</div><div><br></div><div>Can I buy as much as I’d like?</div><div><br></div><div>Pay later is designed to give you a better shopping experience, whether that’s buying a new coat or expanding your shoe collection (trust us, we get it)! But you should only spend what you can afford to pay back. To make sure of this, we take time to get to know you as a customer before enabling you to spend more. From the first transaction we set limits for how often and how much you can spend using Pay later. Limits are determined on a case-by-case basis using affordability checks, and just because you are accepted for Pay later once, doesn’t mean this will always be the case.</div><div><br></div><div>Can anybody use Pay later?</div><div><br></div><div>In short, no. It wouldn’t be responsible of us to offer this to everyone. Pay later is only available to shoppers who can use it safely and in a sustainable way. Pay later acceptance depends on several factors including your previous credit history, your age (you must be at least 18) and a soft credit check. We also have eligibility checks in place and don’t let anyone make a second Pay later purchase until the payment on their first transaction is complete.</div><div><br></div><div>What information do you use to carry out a soft credit check for Pay later? Will my credit score be affected?</div><div><br></div><div>A soft credit check does not affect your credit score/rating and is not visible to other lenders. It stays strictly between us, you, and the agency we use to conduct the credit check. Your credit rating may be impacted if you don’t pay your bills, despite multiple payment reminders, but we will work together with you to try and make sure this doesn’t happen.</div><div><br></div><div>Will I be charged for late payments?</div><div><br></div><div>No. There are no interest fees, or surcharges for late payment penalties with Pay later in the UK, ever. We understand that life is busy, and sometimes we all need a little prompt to stay on top of things. So to help you pay on time, we’ll alert you by email before a payment is due. Payment is typically due 14 or 30 days after the order is shipped, depending on the store.</div><div><br></div><div>What happens if I don’t pay my bills?</div><div><br></div><div>For our Pay later service, if the debt remains unpaid after several months despite multiple payment reminders being sent, the account will be classed as in arrears and then passed to a debt collection agency. We’d never try to catch you out and will do everything we can to help you to find alternative payment arrangements.</div><div><br></div><div>For full Klarna terms and conditions, please use the below link:</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://www.klarna.com/uk/terms-and-conditions/">https://www.klarna.com/uk/terms-and-conditions/</a><br></div></div></div></div> <div class="ecom-block ecom-core core__block elmspace ecom-wa4a41h8xqa" data-core-is="block"><div class="ecom__element element__heading ecom-element ecom-html" data-stopdrag="true" deep="1"><h6 class="ecom__heading ecom-db">Consumer right of return and refund</h6></div></div> <div class="ecom-block ecom-core core__block ecom-trsnc7vhqm" data-core-is="block"><div class="ecom__element ecom-element element__text" data-stopdrag="" deep="1"><div class="text-content ecom-html has-drop-cap-view-framed"><div><span style="color: rgb(35, 35, 35); font-family: Inter; letter-spacing: normal;">This clause only applies if you are a consumer.</span></div><div><br style="box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); font-family: Inter;"><span style="color: rgb(35, 35, 35); font-family: Inter; letter-spacing: normal;">If you are a consumer, you have a legal right to cancel a contract during the period set out below.
